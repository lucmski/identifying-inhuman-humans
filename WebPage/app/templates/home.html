			The following is a showcase of the anaysis that we did on ISIS' Twitter Data.
		</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>Prologue</h3>

		<p id = "data_description">
			In today's world, the thought of going through a day without checking notifications from social media platforms is nearly impossible. Social Media has changed the way we connect and interact with the world. Platforms like Twitter, operate with a simple principle, i.e. open for all, no bias towards anyone, almost like ideal equality. <br>

			The fact that anyone can write about anything to anyone whilst sitting in the comfort of one's home, struggling in office or while in commute, has both a good and a bad side to it.<br>

			Terror groups lke ISIS have been active on Twitter since 2014, the time they captured parts of Syria. They use Twitter to spread hatred, radicalize people and recruit new so called 'soldiers'. An astonishing news came to light in December 2014, when an ordinary Software Engineer in Bangalore Shammi Witness was involved with ISIS, helping them by radicalizing and recruiting people. Astonishing thing about this is that he was doing so openly, without hiding his identity, not using any coded tweets. <br>

			The outreach of such platfroms is worldwide, and thus one can influence masses using such platforms. Cases like Shammi Witness manier times are overlooked or don't come to light.
			<br>

			With this project we tried to make use of our technical knowledge and apply it to tackle this problem.

				<p id = "data_description">
					<!-- We have created a ISIS Twitter dataset which is collection of nearly 30 thousand tweets. Dataset contain 20 features, some of them are hashtag, tweet,userId, user name,location,device used,retweet count, Active since and so on.It took around a month and half to collect the data as there is limitation of fetching data per day therefore we used tweet id to fetch new data every time so that repetition can be avoided .Most of data we collected are against ISIS and their propaganda, but very few supports them which is nearly negligible, as in last  few months ISIS keep lost against kurdish army and was forced out of syria and its effects can be seen on social media,lots of people were tweeting for praising the efforts of army. Twitter handle of ISIS has been significantly reduced in numbers due to strict policies of twitter. -->

					This project was started not only with the aim of analytics but also dataset creation. It may be considered as not so fancy work, but it is the heart of all analytics and machine learning. Thus, initial weeks were spent in data collection.<br>

					We collected real time data in a span of 1 month to 1.5 month. The data is mainly from the hashtags on Twitter like '#ISIS', '#Jihaad', '#ISIL', etc.<br>

					Data collection is done using Twitter API, cosidering the rate limiting, we were able to collect 45K tweets with 20 dimensions, i.e. effectively we ended up with a 45,000 x 20 matrix. It is of considerable size to do some analysis, and thus from this point onwards we moved our focus from data collection, preprocessing, cleaning and formating towards analytics.<br>

					On the right, you can get a glimpse of data. Notice, how clean and well formatted it is. Justice is done to this step!<br>

					Features: <br>
					Date Time <br>
					Location <br>
					Geo Tag <br>
					Tweet ID <br>
					Language <br>
					Hashtags <br>
					User Mentions <br>
					Retweet Count <br>
